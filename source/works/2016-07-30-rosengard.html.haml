A participatory public art workshop conducted in collaboration with Dis/order landscape architecture, on behalf of the City of Malmö as a part of the long term urban development project Amiralsstaden. The focus group were young residents in the area between the ages of 5-15 years, a group that is often left out of urban development processes.<br><br> The piece explores collective shape making. Two sticker shapes, one straight and one curved, were custom made and put in the hands of the participators. Only one construction rule applied: the stickers had to be connected. The material allowed the pathways to be independent from existing structures, and stretched over ground, walls, benches and other obstacles.<br><br>The work is now in process of being scaled up to involve more places in the area and achieve permanent physical changes.
