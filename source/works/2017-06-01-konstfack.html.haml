The identity visualises a green screen and a distorted stock photo of a red carpet. The concept behind these visual choices is to comment on the contemporary media/political climate, where images and facts are open for alternation and manipulation. The question that ignited the process was: how do we do operate as artists when fantasy is hacked by reality? In a d√©tournement spirit, the identity appropriates, or steals back from the mainstream, here a commercial Shutterstock photo to use it for independent/artistic purposes. The visual identity thus describes the school as a place that challenges, and is challenged by, today's rampant societal spectacle. The red carpet symbol can also be read as a celebration of the graduating students.
